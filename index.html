            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML provides many benefits to people, devices, and software reading our HTML documents, and how they're able to comprehend them.</p>

            <ol> <!-- ordered list, displayed content in order-->
                <li> <!-- list item, always used for lists -->
                    Start by pasting just the text of the content into the body of a new HTML document
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Determine the major components of your content</p>
                    <ul> <!-- unordered list-->
                        <li>Main Header - What is your heading content?</li>
                        <li>Main - What is the main content?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Once you determined the major components, determine if there are any sub-components
                </li>

            <h2>How does it help accessibility?</h2>
            <p>Structural, semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.
                When a screen reader, or any sort of assistive device scans a web page, it gets information about the Document Object Model (DOM), or the HTML structure of the page. No styles or JavaScript will be read by a screen reader.</p>

        <h2>Structured HTML and Semantic HTML Fall Hand-in-Hand</h2>
        <p>Structured HTML is the practice of formatting the HTML in the correct order of intended digestion. This means, that the content is organized in the order it was expected to be read.</p>
